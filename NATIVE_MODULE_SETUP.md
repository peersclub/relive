# Native Module Setup Guide

## Current Status
âœ… App runs successfully with mock call detection service
âœ… Error handling implemented for missing native modules
âœ… iOS native modules integrated with Xcode project
âœ… Android native modules configured and ready
ðŸ”„ Ready for physical device testing

## iOS CallDetectionModule Integration âœ… COMPLETED

The iOS native modules have been successfully integrated using automated scripts!

### What Was Done:
âœ… **CallDetectionModule.swift** and **CallDetectionModule.m** added to Xcode project
âœ… **CallKit.framework** linked to the project
âœ… **Project compiles and runs successfully** on iOS simulator
âœ… **Native module available** for call detection

### Automated Integration Script:
```bash
# The integration was completed using:
./add_files_to_xcode.sh

# This script:
# 1. Added both Swift and Objective-C files to the Xcode project
# 2. Linked CallKit framework automatically
# 3. Updated project.pbxproj with proper references
```

### Verification:
```bash
# Build and test (already successful):
npm run ios
# âœ… Builds successfully
# âœ… Launches on iOS simulator
# âœ… CallDetectionModule now available
```

## Android Native Module Setup

The Android module should already be working since we:
1. âœ… Added the module to `MainApplication.kt`
2. âœ… Added required permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`
3. âœ… Created the native module files

### Test Android
```bash
npm run android
```

## Testing Call Detection

### Option 1: Test with Mock Service (Current)
The app currently uses a mock service that simulates call detection for UI testing.

### Option 2: Test with Real Call Detection (After Xcode Setup)
1. Complete the iOS Xcode setup above
2. Run the app on a physical device (call detection doesn't work in simulator)
3. Make or receive a phone call
4. Check the app for automatic call detection

### Development Testing Commands
```bash
# Test on iOS simulator (mock service)
npm run ios

# Test on physical iOS device (real call detection after setup)
npm run ios -- --device

# Test on Android emulator (mock service)
npm run android

# Test on Android device (real call detection)
npm run android -- --device
```

## Expected Behavior

### With Mock Service (Current)
- App starts successfully
- Auto-Detection shows "OFF"
- Can toggle permissions and monitoring buttons
- No actual call detection (simulated only)

### With Native Modules (After Setup)
- App starts successfully
- Auto-Detection can be enabled
- Real call detection works on physical devices
- Automatic recording starts/stops with calls

## Troubleshooting

### iOS Build Issues
1. Clean build folder: Xcode â†’ Product â†’ Clean Build Folder
2. Delete derived data: Xcode â†’ Window â†’ Organizer â†’ Projects â†’ Delete
3. Reinstall pods: `cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install`

### Android Build Issues
1. Clean project: `cd android && ./gradlew clean`
2. Rebuild: `npm run android`

### Module Not Found Errors
- This is expected during development
- The mock service handles missing modules gracefully
- Complete the Xcode setup to enable real functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Complete iOS Setup**: Follow the Xcode steps above
2. **Test on Physical Device**: Call detection requires real device
3. **Add Audio Recording**: Next phase is capturing call audio
4. **Add Transcription**: Convert audio to text for analysis

The foundation is complete - now it's just a matter of connecting the native modules to the build system!
